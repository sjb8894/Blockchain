# Blockchain

# Construction of simple cryptographic hash and Blockchain in C

Secure hash functions possess the following properties: 

  -Randomness: Two similar inputs produce unrelated random outputs
  
  -Onewayness: Easy to compute a hash for a given input, whereas it is hard to compute an input message that produces a given output
  
  -Collision Resistance: It should be hard to find two different messages that result in the same hash
